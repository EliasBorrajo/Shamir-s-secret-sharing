<H1>Project Mathematics S.3</H1>
<H1>Shamir's Secret Sharing</H1>

<H2>Introduction :</H2>
This project is the continuous assessment of the 3rd semester in IT at the HES-SO of Sierre.

<ul>
    <li>Students: Milena Lonfat, Emilie Teodoro Do Nascimento, Jonathan Bourquin and Elias Borrajo.</li>
    <li>Professor: Jean-Luc Beuchat</li>
    <li>Course: 632-2 Mathematics</li>
</ul>

<H2>Functionality :</H2>
<h3>Tool 1 - Generate Parts</h3>
Java command line tool for generating and sharing a secret (Shamir's secret sharing)

Inputs: size of the secret, minimum number of shares to reconstruct the secret, total number of shares to generate

Outputs: the secret shares as well as any useful metadata for the reconstruction of the secret

<h3>Tool 2 - Crypt / Decrypt File</h3>
Command line java tool to encrypt and decrypt a document (text file, Word document,...) or an executable

Inputs: parts of the secret generated by the first tool (and possible metadata), message and operation to perform

Output: encrypted or decrypted message depending on the chosen operation

<H2>Objectives</H3>
<ul>
    <li>Designing a mathematical library in Java</li>
    <li>Develop software based on mathematical libraries</li>
    <li>Apply the knowledge acquired in the first year programming courses</li>
</ul>

<H2>Manual :</H2>
<H3>Installation</H3>
Before use:
<ol>
    <li> Create an environment variable called "SHAMIR" specific to the user, with the specific path on your machine to store the files. </li>
    <li> Control your version of java, it must be in 17.01.1. </li>
</ol>

<H3>Use</H3>
<H4>Use 1:</H4>
<ul>
    <li>In the command prompt use cd to go in the directory where your jar is</li>
    <li>Then use: java -jar "name".jar and enjoy</li>
</ul>

<H4>Use 2:</H4>
<ul>
    <li>Create a text file with java -jar "name".jar, register it as a .bat file</li>
    <li>Run you .bat file and enjoy</li>
</ul>

<H2>Mathematic library</H2>
The mathematical library is in the "ModularArithmetic.java" class and "LagrangeInterpolation.java"

<H3>ModularArithmetic.java</H3>
The "ModularArithmetic.java" is the class that will allow us to perform calculations using operations (methods) such as:
 addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, greatest common divisor, isPrime and modular inverse Euclidean algorithm.
As we can’t use the class bigInt we had to initialized a modulo to 257.

For the addition, subtraction, and multiplication we use the Math.floorMod that returns the floor modulus of the int argument.

<H4>Division</H4>
We calculate a * multiplicative inverse of b

<H4>Power</H4>
If the exponent is <= 0 an arithmeticException is throw because the power can not be <= 0 it should be minimum 1 else we use a loop and the multiplication we created to calculate it.

<H4>Greatest common divisor</H4>
If b = 0 it return a.
Else it return the greatest common divisor of b and a modulo b.

<H4>IsPrime</H4>
Calculate if a number is prime or not, returns ture if it’s a prime number, false if it’s not.

<H4>Modular Multiplicative inverse</H4>
First, we check the inputs. If the modulo param is not a prime number, is under or egal 0, 
the modulo and value are not co-prime, the result of Math.floorMod(value, modulo) is egal 0, 
or the modulo is egal to 1 it throws an exception.
Then we use the Bézout coefficient as long as Math.floorMod(value, modulo) is superior as 0.
And it returns the floor modulus of

<H3>LagrangeInterpolation.java</H3>
<p>The « LagrangeInterpolation.java » used to perform a Lagrange interpolation on an array of points.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Polynomial Interpolation: interpolation of a data set by the polynomial of lowest possible degree.</li>
    <li>Consider a set of k points (x0, y0), (x1, y1), …, (xk-1, yk-1) so that all values xi are distinct.</li>
    <li>There exists only one polynomial f(x) so that degree of f ≤ k - 1 and f(xi) = yi , ∀i ∈{ 0, 1, …, k - 1 }</li>
</ul>

Our method lagrange has two parameters Point[] f that is our array of type point and int n that is our threshold.

With the call of our methods: division, multiplication, subtraction and addition create in our class modularArithmetic.java we can calculate it.

In a first for loop we compute the individual terms: term = f[i].y.

In a second for loop if j is different from i we calculate term= term * f[j].x / (f[i].x - f[j].x)

We calculate result += term and at the end return an int result.
